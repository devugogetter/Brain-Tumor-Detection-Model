# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Model
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based facilitating early detection and classification of brain tumors in the field of medical imaging and accordingly helping in selecting the most convenient treatment method to save patientsâ€™ life.

The following Jupyter Notebook illustrates a methodology that :

The application of deep learning (DL) approaches in context to improve health diagnosis is providing impactful solutions. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), proper brain tumor diagnosis involves detection, brain tumor location identification, and classification of the tumor on the basis of malignancy, grade, and type.

This experimental work in the diagnosis of brain tumors using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) involves detecting the tumor, classifying the tumor in terms of grade, type, and identification of tumor location. This method has experimented in terms of utilizing one model for classifying brain MRI on different classification tasks rather than an individual model for each classification task. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Computer Vision based multi-task classification is equipped for the classification and detection of tumors. The identification of brain tumor location is also done using a CNN-based model by segmenting the brain tumor.


This repository contains :
